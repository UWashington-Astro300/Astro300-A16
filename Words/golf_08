00 To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
01 Whether -tis nobler in the mind to suffer
02 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
03 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
04 And by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--
05 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
06 The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
07 That flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation
08 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--
09 To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
10 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
11 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
12 Must give us pause: there's the respect
13 That makes calamity of so long life;

00 Twas brillig and the slithy toves
01 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
02 All mimsy were the borogoves
03 And the mome raths outgrabe
04 Beware the Jabberwock my son
05 The jaws that bite the claws that catch
06 Beware the Jubjub bird and shun
07 The frumious Bandersnatch
08 He took his vorpal sword in hand
09 Long time the manxome foe he sought
10 So rested he by the Tumtum tree
11 And stood awhile in thought
12 And as in uffish thought he stood
13 The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
